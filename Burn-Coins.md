This might not look like a burn address, but its wif is: Up1YVLk7uuErCHVQyFCtfinZngmdwfyfc47WCQ8oJxgowEbuo6t4
which is the all null privkey: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
which also makes an all null pubkey due to code logic:
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
