AtomicDEX is a mulitcoin lite wallet, as well as a decentralized exchange that utilizes atomic swaps.

For legal reasons, the DEX function in the official version is unavailable to users in `USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Sudan, Austria, and Iran`. There is a version that removes this geoblock that is maintained [here](https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicdex-desktop/releases).
