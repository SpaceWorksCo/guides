### Please Note

AtomicDEX is a mulitcoin lite wallet, as well as a decentralized exchange that utilizes atomic swaps.

For legal reasons, the DEX function in the official version is unavailable to users in `USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Sudan, Austria, and Iran`. There is a version that removes this geoblock that is maintained [here](https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicdex-desktop/releases).

### Instructions

Navigate to [github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases).

Scroll down to `Assets` and download atomicDEX-Desktop for you desired platform. For Windows/Mac, both installer and portable versions are available.

Run the downloaded file.

If you downloaded the installer version, follow the `AtomicDEX-Desktop Installer Setup` to install on your system and then open.

Once AtomicDEX-Desktop is running, select `New Wallet` and complete the steps to setup your wallet.

It is extremely important to backup your seed. It can be used to recover your wallet at any point in the future.
