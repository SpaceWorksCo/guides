### Please Note

AtomicDEX is a multicoin lite wallet, as well as a decentralized exchange that utilizes atomic swaps.

For legal reasons, the DEX function in the official version is unavailable to users in `USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Sudan, Austria, and Iran`. There is a version that removes this geoblock that is maintained [here](https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicdex-desktop/releases).

A trade/swap is comprised of multiple transactions and can take a few minutes to complete.

It is assumed that you have already [setup AtomicDEX-Desktop](Setup-AtomicDEX-Desktop.md) and have coins in your [wallet](Use-AtomicDEX-Desktop-As-A-Wallet.md) to trade.
